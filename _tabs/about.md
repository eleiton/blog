I’m a passionate software developer dedicated to building robust and innovative solutions. 
I’ve been working with software for over 20 years, focusing on the backend side of things.
I'm an advocate for Free and Open Source Software, and primarily develop and deploy applications on Linux, 
with Fedora being my operating system of choice. 
I believe in the power of collaborative development and prioritize open-source software as my first selection due to its transparency, flexibility, and vibrant community!
